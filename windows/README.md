# Installation (Windows)

In `build\dv-annotate.ps1` is a GUI utility as a human-readable script for Windows Powershell 5.1 (the powershell.exe that ships with Windows 10 and later).

This can be installed by right-clicking on the file after downloading and selecting "Run with PowerShell". You will be asked to confirm before the script is installed and a shortcut created to make it easy to run. This should work without installing anything else on Windows 10 or later.

Once this is done the `dv-annoytate.ps1` script will disappear from the directory (it got moved to `%APPDATA%\dV-annotate`) and a shortcut will appear. This shortcut opens the GUI when opened. It can be moved to any location you want and will still work.
