# dv-annotate for Windows

## Installation

[See the build directory](build) for installation instructions. This directory only contains the code.

## About the Code

The code is written entirely in PowerShell and runs without any compilation. Since Windows PowerShell 5.1 comes with Windows 10 and later, it will run on any Windows installation that isn't more than 8 years old or so.

The code isn't that interesting except that it makes use of .NET Windows Forms for the GUI, so it can be interesting for that reason. It's also a concept that can be applied to QA for other games or software.
