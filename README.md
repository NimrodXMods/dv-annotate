# dv-annotate

Annotate and archive save games and logs for the game Delta V: Rings of Saturn to aid in debugging.

See [the wiki article here](https://delta-v.kodera.pl/index.php/DV_Annotate) for more info.

This repo contains two different "dv-annotate" tools.

## Windows

In [`windows/build`](windows/build) is a GUI utility as a human-readable script for Windows Powershell 5.1 (the powershell.exe that ships with Windows 10 and later). Install instructions are located in that directory.

## SteamOS, Linux, OSX

In the [`bash-steamos-linux-osx`](bash-steamos-linux-osx) directory are some very simple and crude bash scripts that do the same as the above, but with no GUI, installation or anything else. These scripts are only intended for people familiar with how to use `bash` (the usual command line shell used in Linux).

## More Info

See [the wiki](https://delta-v.kodera.pl/index.php/DV_Annotate) and the [dV discord](https://discord.gg/dv) `#workshop` channel for more info, to ask questions, or report problems.
